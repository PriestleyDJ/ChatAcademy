More specifically the work presented here applies agent-based simulation and genetic algorithms to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the evolution of cooperation in populations of self-interested individuals. 
The mechanisms proposed and investigated here are from the political and economic sciences, and from theoretical biology. From the political and economic sciences, game theory and particularly the Prisoner's Dilemma suggests a mechanism in the form of reciprocation during repeated interactions among individuals. From theoretical biology, kin selection theory suggests a mechanism in the form of spread of an altruistic trait under genetic control through the benefit it confers on relatives. 
This research aims to further the understanding of the relative importance of each of these mechanisms in explaining observed cooperation within populations of self-interested individuals, the circumstances under which each is favoured, and the way in which they interact. While models investigating cooperation have been designed to use either reciprocal cooperation or kin selection, the study of both mechanisms within the same model has not been carried out. Kin-selected altruism has been suggested as a potential precursor to the evolution of reciprocal cooperation, so the study of both mechanisms together is of interest. Therefore this research presents the design of a model that explicitly supports the operation both of reciprocal cooperation and kin selection. This is achieved by introducing spatial structure to the model, which in conjunction with limited mobility and local interaction and breeding between individuals, has been previously identified as facilitating reciprocal cooperation and kin selection. The model uses 2 x 2 games, primarily the Prisoner’ s Dilemma, to represent social interaction. Individuals within the model are provided with memories of interaction histories with each other, and conditional strategies that act based on these histories, thus providing scope for reciprocal cooperation. The interaction strategies of individuals are encoded as genotypes in a genetic algorithm, and fitnesses are determined by game payoffs from interactions with other individuals, thus allowing natural selection, including kin selection, to operate on strategies. The model is studied in an attempt to identify the contribution of each mechanism to observed cooperation. As an aid to this investigation, models allowing only the operation of kin selection or reciprocal cooperation are presented and studied. Results from the models are investigated using a combination of analytical, statistical and visualisation techniques. 
The main contributions of this research are: 
• the design and investigation of a model explicitly supporting the operation of both reciprocal 
cooperation and kin selection for altruism. This has not been done previously, and is interesting as kin-selected altruism has been suggested as a precursor to the evolution of reciprocal cooperation. 
• the analysis of requirements for models supporting only kin-selected altruism in 2 x 2 games. Earlier invocations of kin selection theory have sometimes been weak. 
• the analysis of requirements for models supporting only reciprocal cooperation in 2 x 2 games. Earlier models have sometimes inadvertently provided scope for altruism through kin selection. 
• the analysis of the operation of, and interaction and dependencies between, kin selection and reciprocal cooperation in 2 x 2 games, revealing in particular the potential for kin selection to act against the evolution of effective strategies for reciprocal cooperation. 
• the analysis of the circumstances under which spatial populations favour reciprocal cooperation, revealing a potential force inhibiting the establishment of reciprocal cooperation in such populations.</api:text></api:field><api:field name="authors" type="person-list" display-name="Authors"><api:people><api:person><api:links><api:link type="elements/user" id="3889" href="https://mypublications.shef.ac.uk:8091/secure-api/v6.13/users/3889"/></api:links><api:last-name>Marshall</api:last-name><api:initials>JAR</api:initials><api:first-names>JAR</api:first-names><api:separate-first-names><api:first-name>J</api:first-name><api:first-name>A</api:first-name><api:first-name>R</api:first-name></api:separate-first-names></api:person></api:people></api:field><api:field name="editors" type="person-list" display-name="Supervisors"><api:people><api:person><api:last-name>Bechkoum</api:last-name><api:initials>K</api:initials><api:first-names>K</api:first-names><api:separate-first-names><api:first-name>K</api:first-name></api:separate-first-names></api:person><api:person><api:last-name>Jordanov</api:last-name><api:initials>I</api:initials><api:first-names>I</api:first-names><api:separate-first-names><api:first-name>I</api:first-name></api:separate-first-names></api:person></api:people></api:field><api:field name="filed-date" type="date" display-name="Date submitted"><api:date><api:year>2002</api:year></api:date></api:field><api:field name="name-of-conference" type="text" display-name="Presented at"><api:text>De Montfort University</api:text></api:field><api:field name="publisher" type="text" display-name="Awarding institution"><api:text>De Montfort University</api:text></api:field><api:field name="record-created-at-source-date" type="date" display-name="Record created at source"><api:date><api:day>13</api:day><api:month>1</api:month><api:year>2011</api:year></api:date></api:field><api:field name="thesis-type" type="text" display-name="Thesis type"><api:text>PhD Thesis</api:text></api:field><api:field name="title" type="text" display-name="Title"><api:text>An Investigation into Kin Selection and Reciprocal Cooperation in a Viscous Population</api:text></api:field></api:native></api:record></api:records><api:fields/><api:relationships href="https://mypublications.shef.ac.uk:8091/secure-api/v6.13/publications/90752/relationships"/></api:object></api:result></api:response>
