What is the abstract of the journal article'Assessing the conditions forin vivo electrical virtual biopsies in Barrett's oesophagus'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Assessing the conditions forin vivo electrical virtual biopsies in Barrett's oesophagus' reads It has previously been shown that it is possible to differentiate between squamous and columnar epithelia in rat and resected human tissues using an impedance probe to make in vitro measurements. This probe can be passed down an endoscope allowing measurements to be made in patients. However, the probe emerges parallel to the oesophageal wall, with little room to manoeuvre. The conditions of control required to give reliable readings have been investigated. The importance of pressure applied and the angle of approach to the oesophagus was assessed. Pressures in the range 26.6 Pa to 46.3 kPa and angles in the range 15-90 degrees were considered. In in vitro studies it was observed that it was possible to obtain consistent readings with pressures greater than 2.9 kPa and with angles greater than 15 degrees between the probe and the oesophagus. These conditions can be achieved in vivo, and readings obtained from twelve patients are shown (45 readings on normal squamous, 34 on Barrett's oesophagus and 22 on stomach). At low frequencies (9.6-153.2 kHz), a Mann-Whitney test shows a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) when comparing the means from squamous and columnar, and also when readings from Barrett's and normal gastric epithelia are compared"
"What is the abstract of the journal article'Mk3.5: a modular, multi-frequency successor to the Mk3a EIS/EIT system'?","The abstract of the journal article titled 'Mk3.5: a modular, multi-frequency successor to the Mk3a EIS/EIT system' reads his paper describes the Sheffield Mk3.5 EIT/EIS system which measures both the real and imaginary part of impedance at 30 frequencies between 2 kHz and 1.6 MHz. The system uses eight electrodes with an adjacent drive/receive electrode data acquisition protocol. The system is modular, containing eight identical data acquisition boards, which contain DSPs to generate the drive frequencies and to perform the FFT used for demodulation. The current drive is in three sequentially applied packets, where each packet contains ten summed sine waves. The data acquisition system is interfaced to a host PC through an optically isolated high speed serial link (RS485) running at 2 Mbaud 12 Mbits s-1). Measurements on a saline filled tank show that the average signal to noise performance of the system is 40 dB measured across all frequencies and that this figure is independent of frequency of measurement. These results suggest that the current system is 10 dB better in absolute terms than the previous Sheffield (Mk3a) system."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Is the short-latency dopamine response too short to signal reward error?'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Is the short-latency dopamine response too short to signal reward error?' reads Unexpected stimuli that are behaviourally significant have the capacity to elicit a short-latency, short-duration burst of firing in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurones. An influential interpretation of the experimental data that characterize this response proposes that dopaminergic neurones have a crucial role in reinforcement learning because they signal error in the prediction of future reward. In this article we propose a different functional role for this ‘short-latency dopamine response’ in the mechanisms that underlie associative learning. We suggest that the initial burst of dopaminergic-neurone firing could represent an essential component in the process of switching attentional and behavioural selections to unexpected, behaviourally important stimuli. This switching response could be a crucial prerequisite for associative learning and might be part of a general short-latency response that is mediated by catecholamines and prepares the organism for an appropriate reaction to biologically significant events.

What is the abstract of the journal article'A computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia. I. A new functional anatomy'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'A computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia. I. A new functional anatomy' reads We present a biologically plausible model of processing intrinsic to the basal ganglia based on the computational premise that action selection is a primary role of these central brain structures. By encoding the propensity for selecting a given action in a scalar value (the salience), it is shown that action selection may be recast in terms of signal selection. The generic properties of signal selection are defined and neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into 'selection' and 'control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure its effective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic modulation. The model contrasts with the prevailing functional segregation of basal ganglia into 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways."
What is the abstract of the journal article'A computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia. II. Analysis and simulation of behaviour'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'A computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia. II. Analysis and simulation of behaviour' reads In a companion paper a new functional architecture was proposed for the basal ganglia based on the premise that these brain structures play a central role in behavioural action selection. The current paper quantitatively describes the properties of the model using analysis and simulation. The decomposition of the basal ganglia into selection and control pathways is supported in several ways. First, several elegant features are exposed - capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and synergistic dopamine modulation -which might be expected to exist in a well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features also lends support to the computational premise of selection that underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the model and biological basal ganglia. Third, the behaviour of the model as a signal selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action selection observed in animals under various levels of dopaminergic modulation."

What is the abstract of the journal article'Modelled current distribution in cervical squamous tissue'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Modelled current distribution in cervical squamous tissue' reads The electrical properties of cervical squamous epithelium have been modelled in the frequency range 100 Hz to 10 MHz. The hierarchical modelling process comprises a cellular level stage, which includes detailed models of cells typical of different depths within the epithelium and a tissue model, which utilizes electrical properties obtained from the cellular models. The fit between the modelled and measured impedance spectra and the distribution of current with depth depends on the macroscopic model structure. Both the properties of the basement membrane and the presence of a surface mucus layer are shown to have a significant effect. The best fit with measured data is obtained when a 10 microm thick, high-conductivity surface layer is included in the tissue model."
What is the abstract of the journal article'The basal ganglia: A vertebrate solution to the selection problem?'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'The basal ganglia: A vertebrate solution to the selection problem?' reads A selection problem arises whenever two or more competing systems seek simultaneous access
to a restricted resource. Consideration of several selection architectures suggests there are significant
advantages for systems which incorporate a central switching mechanism. We propose that the vertebrate
basal ganglia have evolved as a centralized selection device, specialized to resolve conflicts over access to
limited motor and cognitive resources. Analysis of basal ganglia functional architecture and its position
within a wider anatomical framework suggests it can satisfy many of the requirements expected of an
efficient selection mechanism."

The aim of this work is to show the possibility of differentiating these two types of epithelia in terms of their electrical characteristics. For the measurements, we employed a 1.95m‐long, 3.2‐mm‐diameter, four‐electrode probe designed to be used transendoscopically in the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). BE is a condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium of the intestinal type. This metaplasia is considered as a premalignant condition that puts patients at a 30‐125‐fold risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The diagnosis and surveillance of BE involve taking multiple biopsies, an expensive and time‐consuming procedure. This study constitutes the first stage in the replacement of tissue biopsy by “virtual biopsies”.</jats:p>"
What is the abstract of the journal article'Neonatal lungs-can absolute lung resistivity be determined non-invasively?'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Neonatal lungs-can absolute lung resistivity be determined non-invasively?' reads The electrical resistivity of lung tissue can be related to the structure and composition of the tissue and also to the air content. Conditions such as pulmonary oedema and emphysema have been shown to change lung resistivity. However, direct access to the lungs to enable resistivity to be measured is very difficult. We have developed a new method of using electrical impedance tomographic (EIT) measurements on a group of 142 normal neonates to determine the absolute resistivity of lung tissue. The methodology involves comparing the measured EIT data with that from a finite difference model of the thorax in which lung tissue resistivity can be changed. A mean value of 5.7±1.7 Ωm was found over the frequency range 4 kHz to 813 kHz. This value is lower than that usually given for adult lung tissue but consistent with the literature on the composition of the neonatal lung and with structural modelling."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Electrical impedance spectroscopy and the diagnosis of bladder pathology: A pilot study'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Electrical impedance spectroscopy and the diagnosis of bladder pathology: A pilot study' reads Purpose: Carcinoma in situ is an aggressive form of bladder cancer with a high propensity for invasion if left untreated. On cystoscopy these flat lesions cannot be differentiated from other erythematous, potentially benign areas and they require biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Other methods of detecting carcinoma in situ remain experimental. We assessed the effectiveness of electrical impedance spectroscopy, a method that measures the variation of electrical current flow with frequency through the mucosa, for differentiating various pathological changes in the urothelium. Materials and Methods: We obtained 250 impedance measurements immediately after resection in 35 cystectomy specimens using a custom designed probe. Three consecutive readings were recorded per point to assess reproducibility and punch biopsy was done at the measurement site. Results: Changes in the urothelium were classified histologically into 7 subgroups according to the degree of edema and inflammation. Electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements were able to separate benign and malignant changes when tested as a group (p<0.001), although some individual points overlapped. Edema also had a significant effect on tissue impedance (p<0.001). Conclusions: Using measurements we established patterns of electrical impedance in the human bladder. Early results suggest that this minimally invasive technique is able to differentiate benign and malignant bladder pathologies. However, it requires further refinement and evaluation at lower frequencies, where the greatest impedance difference in benign and malignant tissues is expected."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Neonatal lungs: Maturational changes in lung resistivity spectra'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Neonatal lungs: Maturational changes in lung resistivity spectra' reads The electrical resistivity of lung tissue can be related to the structure and composition of the tissue and also to the air content. Electrical impedance tomographic measurements have been used on 155 normal children over the first three years of life and 25 pre-term infants, to determine the absolute resistivity of lung tissue as a function of frequency. The results show consistent changes with increasing age in both lung tissue resistivity (5.8 Ωm at birth to 20.9 Ωm at 3 years of age) and in the changes of resistivity with frequency (Cole parameter ratio R/S = 0.41 at birth and 0.84 at 3 years of age). Comparison with a lung model showed that the measurements are consistent with maturational changes in the number and size of alveoli, the extracapillary blood volume and the size of the extracapillary vessels. However, the results show that the process of maturation is not complete at the age of three years."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Protein structures and information extraction from biological texts: The PASTA system'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Protein structures and information extraction from biological texts: The PASTA system' reads Motivation: The rapid increase in volume of protein structure literature means useful information may be hidden or lost in the published literature and the process of finding relevant material, sometimes the rate-determining factor in new research, may be arduous and slow. Results: We describe the Protein Active Site Template Acquisition (PASTA) system, which addresses these problems by performing automatic extraction of information relating to the roles of specific amino acid residues in protein molecules from online scientific articles and abstracts. Both the terminology recognition and extraction capabilities of the system have been extensively evaluated against manually annotated data and the results compare favourably with state-of-the-art results obtained in less challenging domains. PASTA is the first information extraction (IE) system developed for the protein structure domain and one of the most thoroughly evaluated IE system operating on biological scientific text to date."

The way that the fungus invades the host plant and propagates itself is a very important scientific problem and recent advances in research into the genetic basis of these processes can be used to build a simple partial model using hybrid computational modelling techniques. The possible potential benefits of doing this include the use of computer simulation and automated analysis through techniques such as model checking to understand the complex behaviour of such systems. The example is a metaphor for the process of trying to integrate and understand much of the vast amounts of genomic and other data that is being produced in current molecular biology research. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

What is the abstract of the journal article'A study of the morphological parameters of cervical squamous epithelium'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'A study of the morphological parameters of cervical squamous epithelium' reads Electrical impedance spectroscopy is a technique that has been investigated as a potential method for the diagnosis of epithelial carcinomas. Finite element modelling can provide an insight into the patterns of current flow in normal and pathological epithelium and hence aid in the process of probe design optimization. In order to develop a finite element model of the structure of normal and precancerous cervical squamous epithelium, it was first necessary to obtain the mean values and ranges of a number of morphological tissue parameters. The most important parameters in discriminating normal from neoplastic tissue were identified as being cell size and shape distribution, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic volume ratio and volume of extracellular space. A survey of the literature revealed an absence of reliable quantitative data for these parameters. We therefore present the results of our own basic image analysis on normal and pathological tissue sections, which we hope will be of use to other workers wishing to model cervical squamous epithelium, or other similar tissue structures."

What is the abstract of the journal article'Filament behavior in a computational model of ventricular fibrillation in the canine heart'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Filament behavior in a computational model of ventricular fibrillation in the canine heart' reads The aim of this paper was to quantify the behavior of filaments in a computational model of re-entrant ventricular fibrillation. We simulated cardiac activation in an anisotropic monodomain with excitation described by the Fenton-Karma model with Beeler-Reuter restitution, and geometry by the Auckland canine ventricle. We initiated re-entry in the left and right ventricular free walls, as well as the septum. The number of filaments increased during the first 1.5 s before reaching a plateau with a mean value of about 36 in each simulation. Most re-entrant filaments were between 10 and 20 mm long. The proportion of filaments touching the epicardial surface was 65%, but most of these were visible for much less than one period of re-entry. This paper shows that useful information about filament dynamics can be gleaned from models of fibrillation in complex geometries, and suggests that the interplay of filament creation and destruction may offer a target for antifibrillatory therapy"
What is the abstract of the journal article'Reducing the Variability in cDNA Microarray Image Processing by Bayesian Inference'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Reducing the Variability in cDNA Microarray Image Processing by Bayesian Inference' reads Motivation: Gene expression levels are obtained from microarray experiments through the extraction of pixel intensities from a scanned image of the slide. It is widely acknowledged that variabilities can occur in expression levels extracted from the same images by different users with the same software packages. These inconsistencies arise due to differences in the refinement of the placement of the microarray ‘grids’. We introduce a novel automated approach to the refinement of grid placements that is based upon the use of Bayesian inference for determining the size, shape and positioning of the microarray ‘spots’, capturing uncertainty that can be passed to downstream analysis.

Results: Our experiments demonstrate that variability between users can be significantly reduced using the approach. The automated nature of the approach also saves hours of researchers’ time normally spent in refining the grid placement.

positive and negative evaluations'?","The abstract of the journal article titled 'Connectionist simulation of attitude learning: Asymmetries in the acquisition of
positive and negative evaluations' reads Connectionist computer simulation was employed to explore the notion that, if attitudes guide approach and avoidance behaviors, false negative beliefs are likely to remain uncorrected for longer than false positive beliefs. In Study 1, the authors trained a three-layer neural network to discriminate ""good"" and ""bad"" inputs distributed across a two-dimensional space. ""Full feedback"" training, whereby connection weights were modified to reduce error after every trial, resulted in perfect discrimination. ""Contingent feedback,"" whereby connection weights were only updated following outputs representing approach behavior, led to several false negative errors (good inputs misclassified as bad). In Study 2, the network was redesigned to distinguish a system for learning evaluations from a mechanism for selecting actions. Biasing action selection toward approach eliminated the asymmetry between learning of good and bad inputs under contingent feedback. Implications for various attitudinal phenomena and biases in social cognition are discussed.

resulting from the interaction of cells in epithelial tissue. As proof-of-concept, an agent-based model,
in which there is a one-to-one correspondence between biological cells and software agents, has been
coupled to a simple physical model. Behaviour of the computational model is compared with the
growth characteristics of epithelial cells in monolayer culture, using growth media with low and
physiological calcium concentrations. Results show a qualitative fit between the growth characteristics
produced by the simulation and the in vitro cell models."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Agent-based computational modeling of wounded epithelial cell monolayers'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Agent-based computational modeling of wounded epithelial cell monolayers' reads Computational modeling of biological systems, or ‘in silico biology’ is an emerging tool for understanding  structure and order in biological tissues. Computational models of the behavior of epithelial cells in monolayer cell culture have been developed and used to predict the healing characteristics of scratch wounds made to urothelial cell cultures maintained in low and physiological [Ca2+] environments. Both computational models and in vitro experiments demonstrated that in low exogenous [Ca2+], the closure of 500mm scratch wounds was achieved primarily by cell migration into the denuded area. The wound healing rate in low (0.09mM) [Ca2+] was approximately twice as rapid as in physiological (2mM) [Ca2+]. Computational modeling predicted that in cell cultures that are actively proliferating, no increase in the fraction of cells in S-phase would be expected, and this conclusion was supported experimentally  in vitro by BrdU incorporation assay. We have demonstrated that a simple rule-based model of cell behavior, incorporating rules relating to contact inhibition of proliferation and migration, is sufficient to qualitatively predict the calcium-dependent pattern of wound closure observed in vitro. Differences between the in vitro and in silico models suggest a role for wound-induced signaling events in urothelial cell cultures."

Experiments with the MDL Drug Data Report database demonstrate the effectiveness of fingerprints that encode circular substructure descriptors generated using the Morgan algorithm.  These fingerprints are notably more effective than fingerprints based on a fragment dictionary, on hashing and on topological pharmacophores.  The combination of these fingerprints with data fusion based on similarity scores provides both an effective and an efficient approach to virtual screening in lead-discovery programmes."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Empirically inspired simulated electro-mechanical model of the rat mystacial follicle-sinus complex'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Empirically inspired simulated electro-mechanical model of the rat mystacial follicle-sinus complex' reads In whiskered animals, activity is evoked in the primary sensory afferent cells (trigeminal nerve) by mechanical stimulation of the whiskers. In some cell populations this activity is correlated well with continuous stimulus parameters such as whisker deflection magnitude, but in others it is observed to represent events such as whisker-stimulator contact or detachment. The transduction process is mediated by the mechanics of the whisker shaft and follicle-sinus complex (FSC), and the mechanics and electro-chemistry of mechanoreceptors within the FSC. An understanding of this transduction process and the nature of the primary neural codes generated is crucial for understanding more central sensory processing in the thalamus and cortex. However, the details of the peripheral processing are currently poorly understood. To overcome this deficiency in our knowledge, we constructed a simulated electro-mechanical model of the whisker-FSC-mechanoreceptor system in the rat and tested it against a variety of data drawn from the literature. The agreement was good enough to suggest that the model captures many of the key features of the peripheral whisker system in the rat."

What is the abstract of the journal article'Distinct NF-κB Regulation by Shear Stress Through Ras-Dependent IκBα Oscillations'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Distinct NF-κB Regulation by Shear Stress Through Ras-Dependent IκBα Oscillations' reads <jats:p>NF-κB, a transcription factor central to inflammatory regulation during development of atherosclerosis, is activated by soluble mediators and through biomechanical inputs such as flow-mediated shear- stress. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying shear stress mediated signal transduction in vascular cells we have developed a system that applies flow-mediated shear stress in a controlled manner, while inserted in a confocal microscope. In combination with GFP-based methods, this allows continuous monitoring of flow induced signal transduction in live cells and in real time. Flow-mediated shear stress, induced using the system, caused a successive increase in NF-κB–regulated gene activation. Experiments assessing the mechanisms underlying the NF-κB induced activity showed time and flow rate dependent effects on the inhibitor, IκBα, involving nuclear translocation characterized by a biphasic or cyclic pattern. The effect was observed in both endothelial- and smooth muscle cells, demonstrated to impact noncomplexed IκBα, and to involve mechanisms distinct from those mediating cytokine signals. In contrast, effects on the NF-κB subunit relA were similar to those observed during cytokine stimulation. Further experiments showed the flow induced inter-compartmental transport of IκBα to be regulated through the Ras GTP-ase, demonstrating a pronounced reduction in the effects following blocking of Ras activity. These studies show that flow-mediated shear stress, regulated by the Ras GTP-ase, uses distinct mechanisms of NF-κB control at the molecular level. The oscillatory pattern, reflecting inter-compartmental translocation of IκΒα, is likely to have fundamental impact on pathway regulation and on development of shear stress-induced distinct vascular cell phenotypes.</jats:p>"
What is the abstract of the journal article'Generation of multiple pharmacophore hypotheses using multiobjective optimisation techniques'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Generation of multiple pharmacophore hypotheses using multiobjective optimisation techniques' reads Pharmacophore methods provide a way of establishing a structure--activity relationship for a series of known active ligands. Often, there are several plausible hypotheses that could explain the same set of ligands and, in such cases, it is important that the chemist is presented with alternatives that can be tested with different synthetic compounds. Existing pharmacophore methods involve either generating an ensemble of conformers and considering each conformer of each ligand in turn or exploring conformational space on-the-fly. The ensemble methods tend to produce a large number of hypotheses and require considerable effort to analyse the results, whereas methods that vary conformation on-the-fly typically generate a single solution that represents one possible hypothesis, even though several might exist. We describe a new method for generating multiple pharmacophore hypotheses with full conformational flexibility being explored on-the-fly. The method is based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithm techniques and is designed to search for an ensemble of diverse yet plausible overlays which can then be presented to the chemist for further investigation."

What is the abstract of the journal article'Accounting for Probe-level Noise in Principal Component Analysis of Microarray Data'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Accounting for Probe-level Noise in Principal Component Analysis of Microarray Data' reads Motivation: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets. However, in its standard form, it does not take into account any error measures associated with the data points beyond a standard spherical noise. This indiscriminate nature provides one of its main weaknesses when applied to biological data with inherently large variability, such as expression levels measured with microarrays. Methods now exist for extracting credibility intervals from the probe-level analysis of cDNA and oligonucleotide microarray experiments. These credibility intervals are gene and experiment specific, and can be propagated through an appropriate probabilistic downstream analysis.

Results: We propose a new model-based approach to PCA that takes into account the variances associated with each gene in each experiment. We develop an efficient EM-algorithm to estimate the parameters of our new model. The model provides significantly better results than standard PCA, while remaining computationally reasonable. We show how the model can be used to ‘denoise’ a microarray dataset leading to improved expression profiles and tighter clustering across profiles. The probabilistic nature of the model means that the correct number of principal components is automatically obtained.

"What is the abstract of the journal article'Regional differences in APD restitution can initiate wavebreak and re-entry in cardiac tissue: A computational study
'?","The abstract of the journal article titled 'Regional differences in APD restitution can initiate wavebreak and re-entry in cardiac tissue: A computational study
' reads Background

Regional differences in action potential duration (APD) restitution in the heart favour arrhythmias, but the mechanism is not well understood.

Methods

We simulated a 150 × 150 mm 2D sheet of cardiac ventricular tissue using a simplified computational model. We investigated wavebreak and re-entry initiated by an S1S2S3 stimulus protocol in tissue sheets with two regions, each with different APD restitution. The two regions had a different APD at short diastolic interval (DI), but similar APD at long DI. Simulations were performed twice; once with both regions having steep (slope > 1), and once with both regions having flat (slope < 1) APD restitution.

Results

Wavebreak and re-entry were readily initiated using the S1S2S3 protocol in tissue sheets with two regions having different APD restitution properties. Initiation occurred irrespective of whether the APD restitution slopes were steep or flat. With steep APD restitution, the range of S2S3 intervals resulting in wavebreak increased from 1 ms with S1S2 of 250 ms, to 75 ms (S1S2 180 ms). With flat APD restitution, the range of S2S3 intervals resulting in wavebreak increased from 1 ms (S1S2 250 ms), to 21 ms (S1S2 340 ms) and then 11 ms (S1S2 400 ms).

Conclusion

Regional differences in APD restitution are an arrhythmogenic substrate that can be concealed at normal heart rates. A premature stimulus produces regional differences in repolarisation, and a further premature stimulus can then result in wavebreak and initiate re-entry. This mechanism for initiating re-entry is independent of the steepness of the APD restitution curve.

What is the abstract of the journal article'Initiation of re-entry in an excitable medium: Structural investigation of cardiac tissue using a genetic algorithm'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Initiation of re-entry in an excitable medium: Structural investigation of cardiac tissue using a genetic algorithm' reads <jats:p>The detailed mechanisms by which re-entry and ventricular fibrillation are initiated in the heart remain poorly understood because they are difficult to investigate experimentally. We have used a simplified excitable media computational model of action potential propagation to systematically study how re-entry can be produced by diffuse regions of inexcitable tissue. Patterns of excitable and inexcitable tissue were generated using a genetic algorithm. The inexcitable tissue was modeled in two ways: (i) diffusive, electrically connected but inexcitable tissue, or (ii) zero-flux, areas of tissue electrically disconnected in the same way as zero-flux boundary conditions. We were able to evolve patterns of diffuse inexcitable tissue that favored re-entry, but no single structure or pattern emerged. Diffusive inexcitable regions were inherently less arrhythmogenic than zero-flux inexcitable ones.</jats:p>"
What is the abstract of the journal article'A new dissimilarity measure for finding semantic structure in category fluency data with implications for understanding memory organization in schizophrenia'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'A new dissimilarity measure for finding semantic structure in category fluency data with implications for understanding memory organization in schizophrenia' reads The ordering of words in category fluency lists is indicative of the semantic distance between
items in conceptual memory. Several studies have concluded from structural analyses of
such data, using cluster analysis or multidimensional scaling, that the semantic memory of
patients with schizophrenia is more disorganized than that of controls. Previous studies have
based their analyses on a measure of average inter-item dissimilarity devised by Chan et al.
(1993). Here we derive a new and improved method of determining dissimilarity and show
that when this measure is applied to the fluency lists of patients with schizophrenia the
average pattern of organization for the animal category has similar structure to that of
controls, but with greater variability between individuals."
What is the abstract of the journal article'Comparison of human uterine cervical electrical impedance measurements derived using two tetrapolar probes of different sizes'?,"The abstract of the journal article titled 'Comparison of human uterine cervical electrical impedance measurements derived using two tetrapolar probes of different sizes' reads BACKGROUND

We sought to compare uterine cervical electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements employing two probes of different sizes, and to employ a finite element model to predict and compare the fraction of electrical current derived from subepithelial stromal tissue.

METHODS

Cervical impedance was measured in 12 subjects during early pregnancy using 2 different sizes of the probes on each subject.

RESULTS

Mean cervical resistivity was significantly higher (5.4 vs. 2.8 Ωm; p < 0.001) with the smaller probe in the frequency rage of 4–819 kHz. There was no difference in the short-term intra-observer variability between the two probes. The cervical impedance measurements derived in vivo followed the pattern predicted by the finite element model.

CONCLUSION

Inter-electrode distance on the probes for measuring cervical impedance influences the tissue resistivity values obtained. Determining the appropriate probe size is necessary when conducting clinical studies of resistivity of the cervix and other human tissues.
